## Diving deeper in Titanic statistic data
### Introduction
I downloaded the csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. Which contains passenger data of the most famous ship in history. Analysing the data I will try to answer the questions stated below:  
1. What factors did improve the survival rate? (Age, sex)  
2. What was the average ticket cost (fare) compared to our times (calculating inflation).  
3. Did Port of Embarkation influence the price of the ticket?
